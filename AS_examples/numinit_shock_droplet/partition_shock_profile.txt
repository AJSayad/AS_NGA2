With the current setup, the numerical shock profile that is read into the multiphase simulation must not fall in between processor domains.
This will cause NaNs to arise at the very beginning of the simulation and the profile will not look correct when plotted.

This still needs to be fixed as of 12/10/2024, the work around for right now is to place the shock around processor domains
or to partition the grid in such a way that the shock falls only within one subdomain.
