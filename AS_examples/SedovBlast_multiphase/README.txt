1D Multiphase sedov blast wave simulation. Original problem description: high pressure gas in center of domain with a 1 cell thickness, low (negative) pressure liquid on the left and right sides of gas cell. 

Can be run in the original configuration by using a 1 cell high pressure gas phase by setting Gas Phase Spread = 1 in input file or modified by changing the gas phase spread.
